wiki_relations
==============

Explore two ideias:
-------------------

The first ideia is to do something similar to [wikiviz][], but with a different approach. There is also a wikipedia's page elected as the center point from where our analysis begin. The difference is that instead of using the links to other pages found in the central point, see what are the other pages edited by the editors of the central point.

The other one is to cluster the users based on the relations of the pages edited by then. If two users edited the same page, they are connected.

Some details:
-------------

There should be some way to calculate weights from the connections. Probably there are users that edit lots of pages and users that edit just a few related pages.

For a start, I think I can explore just a small section of wikipedia from the wikipedia [dumps][] or maybe [dbpedia]. There are lots of good ideias in an [article at hackdiary].
